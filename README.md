# UI-UX--Figma

## 1.Table Reservation System for Liitle Lemon Restaurant:
This project is a part of UI/UX design subcourse in Meta Frontend Developer Course. Doing this project, I learned figma basics and how to create a thorough prototype.

### a) Homepage:
Selecting appropriate frames, Designing and placing icons, Typography was the essence of doing this design.

### b) Persona and User Journey Map:
Persona is a user profile i.e an imitation of who might be the actual end users of the Interface.And, User Journey Map gives us insights on what the users feel while interacting with the interface. Persona and User journey maps are essential for developing an amazing user experience.
*The initial step in developing an effective UI design is to understand who are the actual users and how they should feel while interacting the interface. We can interact with he end users and gather required information. Later that information can be used to develop user personas and user journey map.*

### c) Wireframing for table reservation system:
Wireframing in Figma refers to creating a basic, low-fidelity visual representation of a user interface (UI) design. It serves as a blueprint or skeleton of a digital product, like a website or mobile app, focusing on layout and structure rather than detailed design elements.Features of wireframing:
* Includes placeholders for images, buttons, and text
* Leverages Figma's reusable components and layout grids to maintain consistency. Easily replicates elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
* Quick adjustments to layouts or structure based on feedback without worrying about visual polish.

My wireframe for table reservation system consists of five different pages like Home page, Reservation Page, Form page, Confirmation page and Ending Page.

### d) Prototyping:
Prototypes can range from low-fidelity sketches and wireframes focusing on structure to high-fidelity, interactive models that closely mimic the final design. By iterating through prototypes, teams can refine their concepts, reduce development costs, and ensure the end product meets user expectations. Here , I have attached the workflow of my prototype i made for table reservation along with the reusable components i created Like radio buttons, buttons , form input elements , date and time selectors and so on.
